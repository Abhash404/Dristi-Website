            <h2>ASIAN/COSMETIC EYELID SURGERY</h2>
            <p>Cosmetic procedures offer us a way to take an interest in the way we look and feel. With increased safety, reduced recovery time, and affordability, cosmetic surgery continues to be in demand. With today’s healthy lifestyles, we feel better and live longer. Sun damage to skin, smiles and frown lines, crow’s feet, droopy or baggy eyelids are all signs that time, stress, and environmental exposures have deprived us of a younger appearance. When done for cosmetic reasons, it is used to remove excess skin, and/or fat that makes the upper and lower lids puffy and to reduce wrinkling of the skin. Blepharoplasty will restore a youthful and refreshed look to the eyes as it will remove puffiness and bags.</p>
