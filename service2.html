            <h2>CATARACT SERVICES</h2>
            <p>A thorough examination and counseling for cataract is done with discussion on potential visual outcome and complication. Cataract is the clouding of the natural crystalline lens and typically occurs because of ageing and other reasons like prolonged use of steroid drugs, exposure to ultra violet and associated health problems like diabetes and eye injuries. Surgery is the only known effective treatment for cataract removal. All cataract surgeries are aimed at removal of the cloudy natural lens and replacing it with an Intra Ocular Lens (IOL). At the moment Phacoemulsification technique is performed (No stitch surgery) and a foldable IOL is inserted.</p>
